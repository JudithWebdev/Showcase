<h1>2/ Sirk Demets</h1>
<h2>I designed this website for a musician who wanted a website with an overview of his various musical projects. As for the design, I got my inspiration from ancient jazz posters and bauhaus, wich totally suits this musician and his music. Because the fonts and colors are rather bold, I kept the rest of the website as simple as possible. The website is easy to use and responsive as well. It's coded in HTML and CSS.</h2>
