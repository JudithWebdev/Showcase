<h1>4/ Play Me I'm Yours</h1>
<h2>This piano is coded according to the principles of Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript. You can play it by clicking on the keys or by pressing the corresponding keys. I placed this piano in Central Park, New York, where I once saw it.<br><br> Play Me, I’m Yours is a concept by Luke Jerram. Located on streets, in public parks, markets and train stations the pianos are available for everyone to play and enjoy. Play Me, I’m Yours invites the public to engage with, activate and take ownership of their urban environment, and to share their love of music and the visual arts. Decorated by local artists and community groups, these street pianos create a place for exchange and an opportunity for people to connect.
